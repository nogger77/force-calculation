# force-calculation
# This Jupyter Notebook provides conversion of tracking data to force values for an elastomeric pillar across a sequence of images. Position data acquired using ImageJ and TrackMate is used to calculate force values and visualise this in form of plots. This application is to be used alongside the elastomeric micropillar platform as described in:
